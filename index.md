Iâ€™m doing research on how Leading Indicators can improve sales forecasting. Traditional models only look at historical demand data to forecast future expected demand. However, external events can have a big impact on future demand. While there is a lot of external data available, the question arises how to select and include this information in a statistical forecasting model. This model should be comprehensive and transparent, so that business users can understand the contribution of each piece of information.
