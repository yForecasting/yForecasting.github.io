## Welcome to yForecasting! 

Yves R. Sagaert is an Assistant Professor at VIVES University of Applied Sciences (Kortrijk, Belgium). I focus on research on Artificial Intelligence, Sales Forecasting and Leading Indicators. You can follow my [Blog Website](https://yvesrsagaert.wordpress.com/) for stories, updates and case studies. 

This website provides an overview on the more technical aspect of my research and (of course) links to interesting repositories and software packages.

My main research focus is on sales forecasting in a business setting. Here, traditional models typically extraploate historical demand data to forecast future expected demand. However, external events can have a big impact. The business setting is getting more volatile and the impact of external events is increasing. I research how to extend the traditional approach with Leading Indicators. While there is a lot of external data available, the question arises how to select and include this information in a statistical forecasting model. This model should be comprehensive and transparent, so that business users can understand the contribution of each piece of information. 

I hope you find some interesting resources here and don't hesitate to [contact](https://yvesrsagaert.wordpress.com/contact/) me!
